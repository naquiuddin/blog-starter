Neil Armstrong (1930-2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer who became the first person to set foot on the Moon. He was born on August 5, 1930, in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Armstrong developed an early passion for aviation and space exploration, earning his pilot's license before he could even drive a car.

He served as a naval aviator during the Korean War and later joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which would eventually become NASA. Armstrong was selected as an astronaut in 1962 and flew on his first space mission, Gemini 8, in 1966. During this mission, he performed the first successful docking of two spacecraft in orbit.

However, Armstrong is best known for his historic Apollo 11 mission, which took place in July 1969. As the mission commander, he piloted the Lunar Module named Eagle and landed it on the Moon's surface on July 20, 1969. Stepping down from the spacecraft, he famously uttered the iconic words, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," as he became the first person to walk on the Moon.

Armstrong's achievement as the first human on the Moon symbolized a major milestone in human history and space exploration. He and his crewmates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, captivated the world and inspired generations to come. Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971 and pursued a career in academia and private business.

Throughout his life, Armstrong received numerous honors and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. He passed away on August 25, 2012, but his legacy as a pioneering astronaut and explorer continues to inspire people around the globe.
