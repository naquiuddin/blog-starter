Most people after learning frontend developers struggle to find a way to
practice their skills. Given below are few places where frontend developers can
master their craft. Its also a way to showcase their skills and build portfolio.
Go checkout each one of them and start with the ones you like.

### Frontend Mentor

Frontend mentor has readymade specs, designs and assets for you to start
practicing without wasting time. It emulates the real world scenarios and I
think is one of the best ways to practice frontend development.

### Frontend Loops

This website is similar to frontend master, but more atomic. It starts from
building blocks of frontend to improving your skills in making various elements.

### JavaScript 30

If you already know JavaScript and want to practice and improve the skills. Wes
Bos's JavaScript 30 is one of the best resources out there. This is completely
free as well.

### Daily UI

This website is more focused towards designers. They send email daily to help
you become better at designing. However the designs they send are also a way for
you to improve your frontend development skills. One problem you face with this
website is that they don't provide design assests for you.

### Freecodecamp.com

One of the most popular websites to help beginners learn coding and web
development, FreeCodeCamp has good projects both in their curriculum track and
in take home project section. These are also good to showcase them on your
website.
