Motivation is overrated. Please don't chase it. You just need Discipline and a Noble Purpose.

Purpose doesn't have to be some huge life purpose. It can change in future. It has to be simple. Here is a way to find out your purpose.

## Ask this question

What is ONE Thing you need to do/achieve now, such that by doing/achieving it everything else you want to do or achieve become easier or unnecessary?

The answer to this is your **Purpose**. Break it down into [S.M.A.R.T.E.R](https://www.wanderlustworker.com/setting-s-m-a-r-t-e-r-goals-7-steps-to-achieving-any-goal/) Goals and build [Habits](https://tinyhabits.com/join/) for them. Take action every single day. Your need to do your best to make progress every single day.

## Take Action

Both successful and average person feel sad, down and sick. Both of them face difficulties and challenges in their lives. Both of them feel devastated at different points in their lives. What makes the successful person successful is their ability to work hard and make progress, even in the adverse situations. 

Remember, pain and suffering is inevitable on the way to success. Embrace this fact, both pain and suffering are important for us to grow strong. Mohammed Ali, the famous boxer, counts his workout reps only when it starts paining. He says "No Pain, No Gain". Its important to learn and grow from your pain and suffering in order become strong and effective in managing and overcoming it in the future.

So, keep taking action and work hard. There are no shortcuts. There is no replacement for discipline, consistency and hard work.

Once you do or achieve what you want. **Repeat this again**.
